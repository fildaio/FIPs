# FIP-0006 调整DAO分红规则

### 提案动因

经过3个月的发展，FilDA在社区及用户的支持下，存借贷总额峰值超过21亿美金，为全球借贷领域第5名（前4名分别为Compound, MakerDAO, Venus, AAVE）。伴随着更加开放的FilDA 2.0计划启动，现向社区提议对FilDA经济模型进行升级。



FilDA现行方案是每周五拿出协议收入的20%用于兑换HT并按规则空投给DAO池用户。

经过与部分社区成员讨论，现提议调整方案如下，由社区投票决定：

1. 回购并空投FilDA

2. 回购并销毁FilDA

3. 维持目前方案不变



### 提案意图

- 回购并空投FilDA

  定期拿出协议收入的20%用于回购FilDA并空投给DAO池用户。

  该方案直接惠及DAO池用户，促进用户锁仓，但不会改变FilDA的流通量。



- 回购并销毁FilDA

  定期拿出协议收入的20%用于回购FilDA，并转入黑洞地址销毁，销毁完成后第一时间对社区公布，用户可通过区块链浏览器查询，确保公开透明。

  通过此项优化，将有利于降低FilDA的通胀率，所有FilDA支持者都能享受到FilDA总流通量通缩带来的价值提升。



- 保持不变，继续空投HT

  根据现行方案，每周五将协议收入的20%用于兑换HT并按规则空投给DAO池用户。

  该方案通过代币激励的形式鼓励持币人进行DAO锁仓，减少了FilDA的流通量，并惠及DAO用户。但从长远角度来看，无法真正控制FilDA的通胀率。

# FIP-0006 Adjust DAO Airdrop Rules

### Background

After three months of development, with the support of the community and users, FilDA has a peak of more than $2.1 billion in deposits and loans, ranking fifth in the global lending sector (the top four are Compound, MakerDAO, Venus, AAVE) respectively. With the launch of the more open FilDA 2.0 program, it is proposed to the community to upgrade the FilDA economic model.

Filda's current scheme is to take 20% of the revenue from the agreement and convert it into HT and airdrop it to DAO pool users every Friday.

After discussion with some community members, it is proposed to adjust the plan as follows, which shall be decided by the community vote:

1. Buy back and airdrop Filda
2. Buy back and destroy Filda
3. The present programme will remain unchanged

### About new rules
- Buy back and airdrop FilDA
  On a regular basis, 20% of the revenue from the agreement is used to buy back FilDA and airdrop it to DAO pool users.
  This scheme directly benefits the users of DAO pool and promotes the lock-up of users, but it will not change the circulation of FilDA.

- Buy back and destroy FilDA
  Regularly use 20% of the revenue from the agreement to buy back the FilDA, and transfer it to the black hole address for destruction. After the destruction is  completed, it will be announced to the community as soon as possible. Users can query it through the blockchain browser to ensure openness and transparency.
  Through this optimization, it will help to reduce the inflation rate of FilDA, and all FilDA supporters can enjoy the value increase brought about by deflation in  total FilDA liquidity.

- The present programme will remain unchanged
  Under the current plan, 20% of the revenue from the agreement is exchanged for HT every Friday and airdropped to DAO pool users according to the rules.
  The scheme encourages holders to lock up their DAO positions in the form of token incentives, which reduces the circulation of FilDA and benefits DAO users. But in the long run, it is impossible to really control the inflation rate of FilDA.
